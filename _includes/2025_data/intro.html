    The PM4S workshop aims to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners to explore the intersection of
    process mining and sustainability as well as raise awareness for the potential of process mining for supporting
    sustainable development. We want to offer a platform to present work contributing to the topic and foster discussion
    and collaboration on innovative approaches to enhance the environmental and social performance of business
    processes.
