<p>
  With increasing environmental and societal challenges, the urgency for sustainable development becomes paramount.
  Industries, responsible for a significant portion of global emissions and waste, play a crucial role in this
  transition. The “Process Mining for Sustainability” workshop aims to bridge the gap between technological advancement
  and sustainable practices, focusing on the transformative potential of process mining in fostering sustainable
  business processes.
</p>

<p>
  The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) demand a reevaluation of industrial processes and
  organizational practices. Business processes are pivotal in this context. There is a pressing need for concrete,
  scalable solutions to embed sustainability into the fabric of BPM. To fully harness the power of process mining for
  sustainability, it is imperative to advance existing techniques and methodologies. PM4S encourages submissions that
  propose process mining frameworks integrating sustainability-related knowledge, enhance process mining techniques to
  support production and logistics processes, or describe the application of process mining to increase sustainability.
  For instance, object-centric process mining allows for a more nuanced understanding of complex inter-organizational
  systems, providing a ground for methodologies that can significantly advance sustainability.
</p>

<p>
  The objective of this workshop is to showcase the latest research and practical applications of process mining in the
  pursuit of sustainability, foster dialogue between academia and industry, and to develop a joint action plan to guide
  future efforts in this critical domain.
</p>

<p>
  Topics, include anything supporting environmental or social sustainability using Process Mining or works contributing to process mining being capable of doing so.
    They include but are not limited to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Environmental and social aspects of process mining techniques</li>
  <li>Sustainability assessment of processes and systems</li>
  <li>Sustainability indicators in event logs</li>
  <li>Regulatory compliance</li>
  <li>Object-centric process mining for holistic process analysis</li>
  <li>Production and logistics process analysis (IoT, value stream analysis)</li>
  <li>Resilience</li>
  <li>Analysis and simulation of processes with constrained resources</li>
  <li>Sustainability-oriented design and evaluation of PM algorithms</li>
  <li>Extraction of event logs containing sustainability-related data</li>
  <li>Life-cycle assessment, e.g., inter-organizational processes, supply chains</li>
  <li>Circular economy, e.g., material flows, recycling processes, remanufacturing</li>
  <li>Environmental use cases, e.g., renewable energy, waste management, emission</li>
  <li>Social sustainability, e.g., human resources, organizational perspective</li>
</ul>

<h2>Submission Instructions</h2>

We accept the following submission types (page limits include tables, figures, bibliography and appendices):

<ul>
    <li>Full papers (up to 12 pages) illustrating novel research or detailed case studies performed in industry. Each paper should contain a short abstract, clarifying the relation of the paper with the main topics (preferably using the list of topics above), clearly stating the problem being addressed, and the goal.</li>
    <li>Extended abstracts (up to 2 pages) intended for position papers and idea papers exploring or discussing the future steps for PM4S. Extended abstracts will be selected based on their potential to spark engaging scientific discussion or debate. These contributions will be presented during a poster session at the event; authors are responsible for designing and printing their own posters.</li>
</ul>

Papers should be submitted electronically as a self-contained PDF file via the <a href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icpm2025" target="_blank">submission system</a>. When submitting your paper, please select the name of the workshop track, <em>"Process Mining for Sustainability (PM4S)"</em>.
Submissions must be original contributions not published or submitted to other conferences or journals in parallel with this workshop.

At least one author of each accepted paper must register (see below) and participate in the workshop.

<h2>Publication Procedure</h2>

All authors of accepted papers are asked to incorporate the feedback from their reviews until the pre-workshop camera-ready deadline (see above). 
These versions of all accepted papers and extended abstracts will be published centrally with the accepted papers from all workshops co-located with the ICPM.

Full research papers will be published by Springer as a post-workshop proceedings volume in the series Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing (LNBIP). Hence, authors of these papers have time until the post-workshop deadline to update their papers to incorporate insights and feedback they might have gained at the workshop.
The submissions of all versions will be handled via EasyChair.

<h2>Journal Invitation</h2>

The best workshop papers associated with ICPM 2025 will be invited to submit an extended version to the <a href="https://link.springer.com/journal/44311" target="_blank">Process Science journal</a>.
These will not be part of a specific collection (the open-access version of a special issue) but will be regular papers in the regular issues. However, the reviewing time should be shorter as we aim to have an overlap with the reviewing team (one reviewer of the original paper being invited to review the journal version in addition to a fresh external reviewer).

<h2>Registration</h2>
As the PM4S Workshop is co-located with ICPM 2025, all information regarding the registration for the Conference and the Workshops can be found on the <a href="https://icpmconference.org/2025/" target="_blank">main conference website</a>.
